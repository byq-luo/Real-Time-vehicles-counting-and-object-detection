# Real-Time-vehicles-counting-and-object-detection
Steps of the automation:
1. Video capture the real-time traffic condition
2. Run ‘run.bat’, batch file linked up all related scripts including python(for counting and detection), vbscript (run macro vba), vba (webster optimal methods by solver)
3. Start counting vehicles and vehicle type detection (identify private car, motorbike, bus)
4. Integration (increase accuracy)
5. Computation of optimal green by webster optimal in excel
